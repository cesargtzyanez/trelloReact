# trelloReact
This app is created with ReactJs and it emulates the Trello functionality. 
This project is just for learning ReactJs

This app has been made with the Create React App (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), an also with Material-UI (https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-ui), so to run this project is necessary to install it:

npm install material-ui

I will update this repo in order to have an app more close to the real Trello.
